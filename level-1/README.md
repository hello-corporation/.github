# Level 1

These are Hello Worlds that have no runtime dependencies
outside of the standard library of the language in which
they are written.

For example, a Hello World in C that uses `<stdio.h>` and
`printf` would be considered a Level 1 Hello World, as would
a Hello World in Python that uses only the `print` builtin,
or a slightly different program in Python that consists of
`import os` followed by `os.system('echo Hello World')`.

Level 1 Hello Worlds are typically the ones that laymen
outside of the Hello World Industry think of when they hear
the term Hello World.
