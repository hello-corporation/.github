# Hello World!©®™

Welcome to The Hello Corporation, an organization
where all the software is Hello World.

Many other Enterprises in the software space think
we have it easy over here at The Hello Corporation,
because all our software is trivial.

Outsiders seem to think we're a bunch of slackers who
sit around doing nothing and getting high all the time,
which is absolutely untrue, although admittely our
name does spell THC©®™.

In reality, we find that software development at
The Hello Corporation is just as complex and difficult
as it is at other enterprises.

This is not a joke.

We're not making things complex on purpose to make
fun of over-engineered software, like the classic
"Fizzbuzz Enterprise Edition" repo, though that one
was pretty good.

We're absolutely serious.

And recently, the developers at Hello Corporation
have been finding that it's taking them longer and
longer to get anything done, despite extensive efforts
we've put into documention.

If you're reading this, you've been selected for an
interview based on your expertise and obvious charm.

The interview process will consist of one challenge.

We call it:

_The Scalable Hello World Challenge!_

Based on your background, you clearly know a thing or
two about software development.

So we want you to help us simplify things around here,
so our developers can spend less time doing things
manually, and more time writing quality Hello Worlds
at higher levels.

Oh, right, I haven't explained levels.

For more details, see the subdirectories in this
repository called `level-1`,`level-2`, and `level-3`
to get a better idea of the sort of problems we're
dealing with.

Let us know when you've got a working POC of how to
help us scale.

And remember, you don't have write access to our repos,
and we're not looking for PRs that add files to our
existing projects. The Hello World industry is all
about simplicity, so whatever system you build, make
sure to use our projects without changing them.

Sincerely,
-The Hello Corporation©®™
